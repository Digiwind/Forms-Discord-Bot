# **Privacy Policy:**

Last Updated: 02/22/2022
Effective: 03/01/2022

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how information about your data is collected and used by the Owner of the Forms Discord bot (“our” or “we”) while using the Forms Discord bot (the “Service”). By using our Service, you agree with this Policy.

**Data We Collect:** 

- If you click on your note’s download button (the button that contains the word ‘Download’), we temporarily download your note’s content and title and your Discord username and discriminator (e.g. wind#5143) to compile into an electronic text document. After sending you the document, the temporarily created electronic text document is deleted from our system.
- We may store your user ID and associate it with a message ID when you interact with a button or select menu generated from the slash commands: /forms, /vote, and /poll.
  - This data is automatically deleted after 28 days.
- We reserve the right to investigate complaints sent to us by users regarding violations of our Terms of Service, including by evaluating the content of individual notes and forms. 

**Revisions to this Policy:**

If we revise this Policy, we will provide at least 7-days notice in our Service’s help command prior to the revised prior Policy taking effect.
